NOTE: To run these scripts, the post directory in your ESMADIR *MUST* be compiled as
      r8. To do this, first modify the GNUmakefile to:

         1. Set the THIS_GFIO and THIS_CFIO targets to point to r8:

                THIS_GFIO  = GMAO_gfio_r8
                THIS_CFIO  = MAPL_cfio_r8

         2. Comment out the line that says FREAL = $(FREAL4)

                #FREAL = $(FREAL4)

         3. Run this:

               $ make convert_aerosols.x

      This will build a convert_aerosols.x utility that works
